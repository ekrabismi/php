Parameters:    toCheck - postcodeto be checked. 

This function checks the value of the parameter for a valid postcode format. The 
space between the inward part and the outward part is optional, although is 
inserted if not there as it is part of the official postcode.

If the postcode is found to be in a valid format, the function returns the 
postcode properly formatted (in capitals with the outward code and the inward
code separated by a space. If the postcode is deemed to be incorrect a value of 
false is returned.
  
Example call:
  
  if (checkPostCode (myPostCode)) {
    alert ("Postcode has a valid format")
  } 
  else {alert ("Postcode has invalid format")};
